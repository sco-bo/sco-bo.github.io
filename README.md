#About
This is the repo for my personal website [scottbobbitt.me](http://www.scottbobbitt.me)

##Built with:

###Jekyll
I'd heard good things about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and up until now I'd only tangentially messed around with it on another open-source project. My first impressions were that Jekyll sites were pretty snappy, because Jekyll builds [static sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). So I decided to go with Jekyll because of the speed, ease of use, and to learn a little bit more about all it has to offer. I've actually been chroniciling my experience so far and plan to do a write-up for [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) on how to get started using Jekyll. Updates to come soon! 

###GitHub Pages
As you can probably tell, I'm using [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as my host. Have only really had a good experience so far. 

###Foundation
I'm using the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework for the front-end. I've used Bootstrap extensively, and I felt that the web is already bloated with Bootstrap sites, so I decided I wanated to give some love to another framework (with the added benefit of learning more about Bootstrap alternatives).

###Google Domains
Not much to say here. Easy to set up, easy to point to your host, and numerous features I have yet to dig into.
